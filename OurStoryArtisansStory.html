                        “Weaving is in our blood,” he says, recalling how the craft has been passed down since his
                        grandfather’s time. Today, his entire family is involved in weaving and relies on handloom saree
                        sales for their livelihood. To support the family during slow seasons, he also runs a small
                        water-supply tank business. Earlier, a middleman handled their sales, but during the COVID
                        lockdowns, supply chains broke and raw materials ran out. With time on his hands and
                        determination in his heart, he launched “Draupadi Handlooms,” now supplying sarees to shops
                        across Odisha. They once wove kusumi sarees, known for their beauty and high value, but had to
                        stop due to the unavailability of kusumi threads. Still, the loom keeps spinning with hope and
                        heritage.

                        She joined the village weaving center with the hope of making new friends and building a sense
                        of belonging. Her inspiration sparked when she saw her neighbor skillfully working at the loom,
                        and her curiosity to understand the intricate beauty of the craft began to grow. Every morning,
                        she rises early, tidies her home with care, and heads off to the weaving unit with quiet
                        determination. There, she spends her day learning to weave sarees, towels, and gamchas, each
                        thread bringing her closer to the heritage she once only observed. In the evenings, she returns
                        home with tired hands but a joyful heart, resting with a sense of fulfillment. Now, as she

                        started. He learned the craft during his leisure time from his father. In past years a marketing
                        middleman was supplying Kusumi sarees and Bounki pata nationally and internationally. He almost
                        makes one saree per day with 2/3 days of preparing time of threads and sends 20 sarees to a
                        middleman called Mahajan for which he is paid a daily wage of Rs 300/400. Production is affected
                        or slowed during monsoon season due to issues with the drying of threads that are soaked in dye.
